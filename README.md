# Fake Review Detection Model with CNN and Scikit-Learn

This project implements a Fake Review Detection model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Scikit-Learn, with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using PyQt5 and QtPy. The goal of this project is to classify reviews as either genuine or fake based on their textual content.

## Project Overview

### 1. Model
- **Architecture**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for text classification.
- **Libraries Used**: TensorFlow/Keras for CNN, Scikit-Learn for model evaluation.
- **Dataset**: The dataset used includes various reviews labeled as fake or genuine.

### 2. GUI
- **Interface**: Built using PyQt5 and QtPy.
- **Functionality**: Allows users to input reviews and get predictions on whether the review is fake or genuine.

## Features

### Model
- **Text Classification**: Classifies reviews into fake or genuine categories.
- **Training**: Trained using a CNN model to effectively handle text data.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluated with performance metrics to ensure accuracy.

### GUI
- **User Input**: Allows users to enter review text.
- **Prediction**: Displays the classification result directly on the GUI.
- **Styling**: Designed with a modern and user-friendly interface.
